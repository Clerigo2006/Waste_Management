# Waste_Management BSIT-1D Group_2

Community Problem Description that are trying to be solve:

A. Traditional and Manual Waste Monitoring. Current waste tracking is primarily **paper-based, making it prone to data loss, human error, and limited accessibility**. Without a centralized system, it becomes difficult to track waste collection schedules, frequency, volume, and area coverage efficiently.

B. Lack of Real-Time Data and Reporting. **There is no structured way to gather or share real-time data regarding uncollected garbage, or areas with frequent waste overflow.** Residents have no immediate platform to report issues, which delays action.

C. Limited Community Awareness and Involvement. Most community members are **not regularly informed or engaged in local waste management efforts.** Traditional bulletin boards and word of mouth communication are no longer effective for encouraging proper waste disposal and segregation practices.

D. Overworked Barangay Personnel. **Barangay officials and sanitation workers face increasing pressure as population and waste volumes grow.** Manual methods make it harder to efficiently allocate resources, respond to concerns, and enforce local ordinances.

E. Poor Waste Sorting and Rule Checking. Because there is no proper system, **it’s hard to check if people are sorting their waste correctly.** It’s also difficult to know who is following the rules and who is not. This makes it harder to teach and remind people about proper waste disposal.
